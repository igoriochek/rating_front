# MetaMask Integration Project

## Overview

This project integrates MetaMask functionalities with a web interface, allowing users to interact with blockchain-based services such as logging in, submitting reviews, registering items, searching for items and domains, and fetching item information. The project is divided into several components, each handling a specific functionality.

## Project Structure(NEW Part)

### Page Directory
- `contractInteraction.js`: Handles interactions with the smart contract, including registering items, submitting reviews, and fetching item information.
- `dynamicProductInfo.js`: Manages the dynamic display of product information based on user input.
- `page.html`: Main HTML file that includes sections for MetaMask login, product reviews, and dynamic product information.
- `styles.css`: Contains styles for the entire application.

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Product Display**:
   - The product name and details are dynamically displayed based on the product identifier passed through the HTML `<script>` tag.
   - Average product ratings are calculated based on existing reviews and displayed as stars.

2. **MetaMask Integration**:
   - Users are required to connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the review system.
   - The connection process is triggered after the page load or the user clicks the "Connect to MetaMask" button.
   - Upon connection, the MetaMask button disappears, and the userâ€™s review options are displayed.

3. **Review Submission**:
   - Once connected, users can submit reviews for the product, including a star rating and a written comment.
   - Reviews are stored on a blockchain, and the submission includes blockchain interaction via smart contracts.
   - After submission, the review list is updated dynamically.

4. **Review Display**:
   - Users can view a scrollable list of all reviews for the product.
   - If a user has already submitted a review, their review is highlighted and shown at the top of the list.
   - The rating system uses stars, with partial star rendering for ratings like 4.5.

5. **Loading and Error Handling**:
   - A loading spinner is displayed when submitting a review.
   - If the transaction is rejected or fails, the form is redisplayed with an error message, allowing the user to try again.

### Usage:
- The main functionality is encapsulated in the `dynamicProductPage.js` and `contractInteraction.js` files.
- Ensure the MetaMask extension is installed in the browser for blockchain interaction.
- The `page.html` file provides the HTML structure, which includes the product name passed via a `<script>` tag.

### Example Usage:
- `<script src="dynamicProductPage.js" data-itemname="YourProductName"></script>`
